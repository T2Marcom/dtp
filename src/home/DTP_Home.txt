*Advancing Thermoelectrics</h1>
**A new approach to solid-state thermal management</h2>

<!-- Intro -->
If you think thermoelectric technology has reached its limits, think again. Our patented *distributed transport properties* (DTP) approach to thermoelectric systems promises dramatic increases in heating and cooling efficiency and capacity. Our advances are making electric-based, solid-state thermal management an efficient, sustainable candidate for large-scale thermal management applications.</p>
