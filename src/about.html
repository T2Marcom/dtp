        <p>
            DTP Thermoelectrics is focused on creating and licensing next-generation
            thermoelectric technologies that will improve a broad range of applications—including internal combustion
            and electric vehicles, cold chain logistics, medical devices, HVAC equipment and much <a
                href="/applications">more</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our engineers are developing solid-state cooling and heating systems based on our patented <a
                href="/our-technology">Distributed Transport Properties (DTP)</a> thermoelectric technology, which
            delivers efficiency improvements up to 140% and capacity improvements up to 200% compared to conventional
            thermoelectric systems. These advancements will, for the first time in many cases, enable the use of
            thermoelectric systems to address large-scale thermal management challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Previously known as Lon Bell Consulting, our company was founded in 2014 by Lon Bell with a vision to
            develop a new generation of thermoelectric systems for use across multiple industries. As a pioneer in
            thermoelectric technology, Bell recognized that cooling and heating technology must evolve from its
            fluid-based roots to meet new demands for efficiency, sustainability and cost-effectiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
            After several years of research to perfect the technology, DTP Thermoelectrics is now pursuing engagements
            with automotive, cold chain and electronics companies to integrate DTP technology into their products.

                    Dr. Bell is a leading expert in the development and mass production of high-reliability electromechanical systems and solid-state thermoelectric products. He founded Amerigon, Inc. (now Gentherm, Inc., NASDAQ: THRM), the world’s largest supplier of thermoelectric devices, and also led Amerigon subsidiary BSST LLC. Bell founded Technar, Inc., which developed and mass-produced automotive airbag crash sensors and other proprietary electromechanical components, and co-founded Mahindra REVA Electric Vehicle Co. Ltd., an Indian electric vehicle manufacturer. He served on the board of directors of ClearSign Combustion (CLIR) and Ideal Power (IPWR) and is currently on the board of directors of Clean Diesel Technologies, Inc. (CDTI). Dr. Bell has served as a member of the Scientific Advisory Board at Michigan State University’s Energy Frontier Research Center, a multi-university consortium conducting fundamental research in solid-state energy conversion technologies, and served in a similar role at the University of California at Santa Barbara’s Institute for Energy Efficiency. He is the former chairman and current board member of the External Advisory Board for the Mechanical and Civil Engineering Department at the California Institute of Technology. Bell has authored more than 40 publications in the areas of thermodynamics of thermoelectric systems, automotive crash sensors and other electronic and electromechanical devices and holds over 100 patents. He received a bachelor of science in Mathematics in 1962, a master of science in Rocket Propulsion in 1963 and a doctorate in Mechanical Engineering in 1968, all from the California Institute of Technology.
