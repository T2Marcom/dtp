# About Us
## Advancing thermoelectric systems


DTP Thermoelectrics is an integration company focused on creating and licensing next-generation thermoelectric technologies that will improve a broad range of applications—including internal combustion and electric vehicles, cold chain logistics, medical devices, HVAC equipment and much [more.](/applications) 


Our engineers are developing solid-state cooling and heating systems based on our patented [Distributed Transport Properties (DTP)](/technology) thermoelectric technology, which promises efficiency improvements up to 30% and capacity improvements up to 300% compared to conventional thermoelectric systems. These advancements will, for the first time in many cases, enable the use of thermoelectric systems to address large-scale thermal management problems. 


Previously known as Lon Bell Consulting, our company was founded in 2014 by Lon Bell with a vision to develop a new generation of thermoelectric systems for use across multiple industries. As a pioneer in thermoelectric technology, Bell recognized that cooling and heating technology must evolve from its fluid-based roots to meet new demands for efficiency, sustainability and cost-effectiveness. 


After several years of research to perfect the technology, DTP Thermoelectrics is now pursuing engagements with automotive, cold chain and electronics companies to integrate DTP technology into their products.
