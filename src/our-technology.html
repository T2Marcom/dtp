        <p>
            DTP Thermoelectrics is an integration company focused on creating and licensing next-generation
            thermoelectric technologies that will improve a broad range of applicationsâ€”including internal combustion
            and electric vehicles, cold chain logistics, medical devices, HVAC equipment and much <a href="/applications">more</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our engineers are developing solid-state cooling and heating systems based on our patented <a href="/technology"></a>Distributed Transport Properties (DTP)</a> thermoelectric technology, which delivers efficiency improvements up to 30% and capacity improvements up to 300% compared to conventional thermoelectric systems. These advancements will, for the first time in many cases, enable the use of thermoelectric systems to address large-scale thermal management challenges. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Previously known as Lon Bell Consulting, our company was founded in 2014 by Lon Bell with a vision to
            develop a new generation of thermoelectric systems for use across multiple industries. As a pioneer in
            thermoelectric technology, Bell recognized that cooling and heating technology must evolve from its
            fluid-based roots to meet new demands for efficiency, sustainability and cost-effectiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
            After several years of research to perfect the technology, DTP Thermoelectrics is now pursuing engagements
            with automotive, cold chain and electronics companies to integrate DTP technology into their products.
